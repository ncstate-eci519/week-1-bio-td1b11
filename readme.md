## About Me
Hello everyone!
My name is Tracy and I currently live in Charlotte although, we're trying to get to Raleigh!  I'm a store director for [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/) and love what I do.  My goal is to someday work for corporate as an instructional designer. Other than education, I have a passion for animals. We have three dogs and two cats which makes for a very busy household! I thoroughly enjoy traveling and hoping to get to [Bora Bora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_Bora) some day! We have been to many vineyards in North Carolina which supports my love for red wine. Anti-oxidants are important you know! I'm excited for this class as it'll be an extreme challenge for me. I took it since I'm not as computer savvy as I'd like to be. I'm trying to ignite my growth mindset! This is my first year back in graduate school after 20 years!!!! I may be asking a lot of questions.
